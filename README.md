# Positio

This android application was built for HackDTU and under the theme of health and medicine. 
It helps you keep track of your posture and sends a notification if you continue to maintain an incorrect posture for a long period of time.

This application receives data from an API, which receives it's data from two infrared sensors fixed at a chair, and this helps detect the person's posture. It notifies the user regardless of the state of the application, whether or not it is running. 

This project was the 1st runner up in the competition and received access to a startup accelerator program worth $3600 from SendGrid.
